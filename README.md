# find-replace
Find and replace strings within your text files.

Originally found this code here:
https://gist.github.com/twhitney11/3803245

and decided to update it to work with PHP 8.0

It now allows the file types to search to be input on the CLI.

Change $limit_to_dirs and $dirs_to_skip to suit your particular needs.
