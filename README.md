# find-replace
Find and replace strings within your text files.

Originally found this code here:
https://gist.github.com/twhitney11/3803245

and decided to update it to work with PHP 8.

*Tested on PHP versions 8.0. to 8.4*

It now allows the file-types-to-search to be input on the command line.

You can change `$limit_to_dirs` and `$dirs_to_skip` to suit your particular needs.
